Creating HTML file:

- Create html-boilerplate folder, and inside it index.html
its always good to name the homepage of our website index.html as web servers by deafult
will look for an index.html file.

The DOCTYPE:

The DOCTYPES function is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use render the
document. The latest version is HTML5, the doctype for it is: <!DOCTYPE html>

- Add <!DOCTYPE html> to the index file on the first line.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML element:

after doctype we need to add a <html> element, this is known as the root element of the document, 
every other element will be a descendent of it. Every HTML document must have it.

- Add the <html> element to the index using the opening and closing tag as shown:
<html lang="en">
</html>
The html tag uses a lang attribute, attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML
elements.

The lang attribute specifies the language of the text content in that element. this is used to mainly improve 
accessibility of the webpage. allowing assistive technologies such as screen readers to adapt according to the 
language and invoke the correct pronunciation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head element:

The <head> element is where important meta-information about our webpages go, and stuff required to render the pages 
correctly in the browser. elements which display on the webpage should not be used in the head.

Meta element:

There should always be a <meta> tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the <head>:
<meta charset="utf-8">
Setting the encoding is important as it makes sure the webpage displays special symbols and characters from other languages 
correctly in the browser.

Title element:

The <title> element should also be included in the head of the html document.
<title>My First Webpage</title>
The title element gives a human readable title on the browsers tab for the webpage. if a title isnt included the tab will be 
titled the file name of the html document, index.html

- Now add these three elements to the index.html file, inside the html element. as below:

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Body element:

The final element to complete the boilerplate is the <body> element. This is where all content which is displayed to users will
go. text, images, lists, links etc.

- Add the <body> element to the index.html file, it goes inside the html element and always below the head element.
as below:

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>My First Webpage</title>
    </head>

    <body>
    </body>
</html>
