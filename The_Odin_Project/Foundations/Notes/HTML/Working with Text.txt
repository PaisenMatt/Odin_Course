Introduction:

Most content on the web is text-based, therefore alot of text elements will be used whilst working
with HTML. So here we will go over paragraphs, headings, bold text, italicized text, relationships between
nested elements and HTML comments. These all go inside the body element.

Paragraphs:

Paragraphs use the <p> opening tag and </p> closing tag to wrap text, for example:

<body>
    <p> Hello world, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headings:

Headings are different from other text elements, they are displayed larger and bolder than other text, to show 
that they are headings.

There are six levels of headings, from most important and largest to least important and smallest. <h1> to <h6>.
To create a heading we wrap text around heading opening and closing tags <h1></h1>. For example:

<body>
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
</body>

Using the correct heading is important, to provide levels of hierarchy to content. h1 being for the overall page,
and the smaller for content on smaller sections of the page.

Strong element:

The <strong> element makes text bold. it also semantically marks text as important; affecting tools like screen 
readers, which users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on some screen~
readers changes to communicate the importance of text inside a strong element. Example:

<body>
    <strong>Im Strong</strong>
</body>

This element most likely will be used alot in combination with other text elements. For example:

<body>
    <p> <strong>Hello world</strong>, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Em element:

The <em> element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which once again may affect
things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element, wrap text in an <em> tag. For example:

<body>
    <em>Some emphasised text</em>
</body>

Just like the strong element it will probably end up being used wwith other text elements. For example:

<body>
    <p> <em>Hello world</em>, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>

Nesting and indentation:

All examples through out the notes elements which are within other elements are indented. This known as nesting

When nesting elements within others, a parent and child relationship is created between them. The nested being the 
children and the outter elements being the parent.

Just like human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many children. elements nested at the same level are 
considered siblings. For example, the two paragraphs below are children to the body tag and siblings to eachother:

<body>
    <p>This cake is delicious</p>
    <p>It really is!</p>
</body>

We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves and others developers who will 
work on our HTML in future. its recommended to indent child elements by two spaces.

The parent, child and sibling relationship will become even more important for when styling with CSS and adding
behavior with JavaScript.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML comments:

HTML comments are not visible to the browser, they allow us to comment on our code for other developers and for 
ourselves in future to understand something in code which may not be clear.

To write comments, we enclose the comment with <!-- and --> tags, Example below:

<h1> View the html to see the hidden comments </h1>

<!-- I am an html comment -->

<p>Some paragraph text</p>

<!-- I am another html comment -->
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task:

- Create a plain blog article page, using different headins, paragraphs, and some bolded and italicized text in 
paragraphs. for dummy text use Lorem Ipsum, just type lorem in the text element and press enter for VS to generate
the dummy text.
