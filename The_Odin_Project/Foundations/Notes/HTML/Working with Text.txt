Introduction:

Most content on the web is text-based, therefore alot of text elements will be used whilst working
with HTML. So here we will go over paragraphs, headings, bold text, italicized text, relationships between
nested elements and HTML comments. These all go inside the body element.

Paragraphs:

Paragraphs use the <p> opening tag and </p> closing tag to wrap text, for example:

<body>
    <p> Hello world, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>

Headings:

Headings are different from other text elements, they are displayed larger and bolder than other text, to show 
that they are headings.

There are six levels of headings, from most important and largest to least important and smallest. <h1> to <h6>.
To create a heading we wrap text around heading opening and closing tags <h1></h1>. For example:

<body>
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
</body>

Using the correct heading is important, to provide levels of hierarchy to content. h1 being for the overall page,
and the smaller for content on smaller sections of the page.

Strong element:

The <strong> element makes text bold. it also semantically marks text as important; affecting tools like screen 
readers, which users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on some screen~
readers changes to communicate the importance of text inside a strong element. Example:

<body>
    <strong>Im Strong</strong>
</body>

This element most likely will be used alot in combination with other text elements. For example:

<body>
    <p> <strong>Hello world</strong>, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>

Em element:

The <em> element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which once again may affect
things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element, wrap text in an <em> tag. For example:

<body>
    <em>Some emphasised text</em>
</body>

Just like the strong element it will probably end up being used wwith other text elements. For example:

<body>
    <p> <em>Hello world</em>, this is my first paragraph. thank you for taking the time to read it.
    I hope you all enjoy my website</p>
</body>
