Elements and tags:

Almost all elements in HTML are content wrapped in an opening and closing tag.

Opening tags tell the browser the start of an element. the tag contains a keyword inclosed in angle brackets.
For example a paragraph element will start with <p>

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. this tag is the same as the opening but includes a foward 
slash before the keyword. 
Example for paragraph closing bracket </p>

A full paragraph element looks like this: 
<p> Konnichiwa </p> , inside the tag goes the text content. Think of elements as containers for content.

Using the correct tags for content is very important, in two aspects: How they are ranked in search engines
and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers.

The use of the correct elements is called semantic HTML.

Void Elements:

Some elements have not closing tag. They have a single tag like: <br> or <img>. They are called void elements because
they are void of any content, there is nothing inside of them. wihtout a closing tag they cant wrap content like other tags.

They can also be referred to as self closing tags, but those are void elements with a foward slash, for example:
<br /> or <img /> .
Browsers will display them fine but the latest version of HTML specification discourages their use and considers them invalid.
