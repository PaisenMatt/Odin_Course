Introduction:

Lists are everywhere on the web for all sorts of things such as top 10 anime etc. eventually we will need to use them
on our own webpages.

HTML provides us with a couple of different types of lists. here we will cover unordered and ordered lists.

Unordered lists:

If you wish to have a list of items where order doesnt matter, like a shopping list where items can be bought in any 
order, then we can use an unordered list.

Unordered lists are created using the <ul> element, and each item within the list is created using the list item element
<li>. Example below:

Each item within an unordered list begins with a bullet point when displayed by the browser:

<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ordered lists:

If you want to create a list where order of items does matter, like a step-by-step guide. then we can use an ordered list.

Ordered lists are created using the <ol> element, each item is then created use <li> again. but each item begins with a number
instead, Example below:

<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
