Commands related to a remote repository:

- git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
- git push or git push origin main (both do the same thing, but the second one specifies the branch)

Commands related to the workflow:

- git add .
- git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history:

- git status
- git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination

For example,

'git add .' is read as 'git | add | .' where vthe period represents everything in the current directory.

'git commit -m "message" ' is read as 'git | commit -m | "message" ' 

'git status' is read as 'git | status | (no destination)'


Atomic Commits:

When possible, a commit should be as small as possible such as a single feature, change or fix. trying to keep each commit focused on a single think. This makes it easier to rollback or undo changes later. also makes the project easier to review.
