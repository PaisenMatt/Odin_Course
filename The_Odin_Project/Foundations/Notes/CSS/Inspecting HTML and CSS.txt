Viewing and changing the DOM:
 
DOM (Document Object Model) is used to change page structure, style and content using javascript, itâ€™s a tree like structure with nodes representing the HTML elements. It looks like the HTML.
 
The HTML represents the initial page content, where as the DOM represents the current page content when Javascript changes the initial HTML document.
 
Using $0 in the console shows the current element/DOM node.
Using $0.textContent allows you to change the text content.
 
You can also edit the DOM directly on the elements panel.
